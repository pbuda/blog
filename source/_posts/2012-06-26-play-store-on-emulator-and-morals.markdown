I've recently noticed that I have some traffic to my blog from [some question posted on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11154222/google-play-in-android-4-0-emulator). I checked out the question out of curiosity and what I found made me wonder, particularly [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11155703/840794). I don't have enough rep to comment on other answers, so I decided to rant here a little.

I understand that Google doesn't want their Play Store available on devices that are not licensed, I don't pretend to know why, I can only guess. But I don't want to be called a software pirate. I did not rip Play Store from a device nor I distribute it. The Play Store apk that I used comes from CyanogenMod page, AFAIK the Google apps package for CM is the only way for their users to update Google apps. Is this also pirating?  If so, we have SO MANY pirates in Android world then! There are more than [one million CM users](http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/) out there so that means more than one million people pirate Play Store. Not to mention some Kindle Fire users who install Play Store on their rooted devices.

I am no lawyer, but after reading Google Play EULA several times, I don't find any point that prohibits me from installing it on emulator. Now Google did make an attempt to limit Play Store use on emulator (even if not on purpose) by using DRM protection which makes Google Play not work on emulator anyway - [you can't download apps!](http://www.piotrbuda.eu/2012/06/trying-to-solve-error-491-in-play-store.html)

Rant over, I just needed to vent.
