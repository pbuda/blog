**[Update 2013-05-14] I will no longer keep this project on my GitHub, I didn't have time to play with it and most likely this is already obsolete API. It has been removed.**

~~If anyone is interested, I mirrored a great project: [Android Market API](http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/) and it's now available [on GitHub.com](https://github.com/pbuda/playstoreapi). I am using this API for my yet-to-be announced Android project and because of lack of support from original authors I decided to mirror it and introduce fixes/new features.~~

~~Currently I'm reworking the API of the project, but for now you can download the sources and build with Maven OR download the jar directly from project downloads section.~~

~~However, please notice that I focus on making this library work well on Android devices because in order to work properly it requires actual Android device capable of running Play Store.~~
