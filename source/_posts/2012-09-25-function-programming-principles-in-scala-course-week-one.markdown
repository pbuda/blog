So the course started a week ago and I'd like to share my opinion after the first week.

First of all I got this feeling that most people attending the course thought that it'll be a Scala course. While Scala is used to demonstrate functional programming principles it is not a Scala course. You have to know Scala on your own, however for now Martin Odersky does explain it's syntax. If you're into learning Scala only, this is not a course for you IMO.

Lectures are recorded with good quality and Martin's English is very good, he also speaks slowly. This is OK for people who have problems with understanding English and for those who don't, you can increase video speed to 1.25x or even 1.5x and it's still quite easy to understand what he's saying.

Since it's my first Coursera course, I was surprised with the first quiz during a lecture :) but these are nice little stops for you to think. Sometimes you have to check a proper answer and sometimes you are only asked to do something on your own.

As for assignments, they are pretty clear. You have to do a thing or two and submit your solutions. Altough there are tests written for you already, the very first thing that I did for the first assignment was adding a few tests for corner cases. Later on things were smoothly as the assignments were not that hard.

I've had a few problems with the countChange function but mainly because I made some wrong assumptions (thanks go to [@marcinderylo](https://twitter.com/marcinderylo) for pointing that out to me). I didn't use Eclipse or Intellij Idea for the first assignment - I used vim and just set tests to run continously in sbt. For the next week I plan to use Intellij, however the course is setup using Eclipse (it's probably easier to do, since Scala plugin for Intellij is like alpha stage).

And that's it. This is the first 'real' learning since I finished university, but this time it's for the good cause :) I hope everyone enjoys the course and I really hope that my skills in functional programming will benefit from the it.
