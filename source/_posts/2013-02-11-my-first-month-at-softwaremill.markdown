The year 2012 was a year of change to me. First I was moved to a new team in CGM Poland. Things were nice at first, but after a while I lost all my motivation to work. It was time to change the organization and so I applied to a company called [SoftwareMill](http://www.softwaremill.com). 
Why them? Trully a coincidence. I was browsing some stuff on LinkedIn and I stumbled upon their job posting and I got intrigued by the fact that they mentioned possibility to work from home. As it turned out, the whole team is distributed! But then I took a closer look at the company and noticed that on SoftwareMill website there's a [section about developers](http://softwaremill.com/why-softwaremill/our-team). Browsing short descriptions of those who worked there I thought that it was a very good company to work at. So I applied in August. It took a longer while to finish the recruitment process (I wasn't accepted at first), but I finally started work at SoftwareMill on 2nd January 2013.

Now a month has passed and I have to say that I'm very happy I was given the chance. Not only have I met some brilliant people but it was also a great cultural change for me: from big company, corporation, to a smaller entity with more focus on single developers.

This experience is quite pleasant. Frequent code reviews is something I often missed in my previous jobs but here I have them almost every push to Git repo. That's reassuring, as any mistake I make may be quickly recognized by someone else, but I think I don't have to stress out how important code reviews are :)

The next thing I'd like to mention is the Scrum/Chrum meetings. Every team has a Scrum sometime before 10:00. It's your normal Scrum meeting where you answer the three questions. Then is the Chrum meeting. Since the team is distributed, we don't see each other normally, so at 10:00 we have a video meeting where we answer additional, fourth question. This question can be anything - from what was your yesterday's dinner to how does your surrounding look like at the moment. This is really quite fun meeting and most importantly it's self organizing. There is no specific order at which people speak out but we usually end the meeting around 10:20. When the official meeting is over we are free to discuss about anything.

Working from home was something I always wanted to try and now I have the chance. I was affraid though that some responsibilities might take over my work (like cooking dinner, for example) but fortunately that's not the case. I think I adapted pretty quickly to working from home, [despite many distractions](http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2013-02-10/). There are occasional problems, like having a sick kid at home, but other than that, distractions can be avoided. It's also worth noting that remote work does not equal to working from home, which I hope to prove sometime soon :) 

For now I'm developing this open source project called [SML Bootstrap](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootstrap) and while it's nothing too big, it helps me to familiarize with how things work at SoftwareMill. I also encourage you to check this project out - it's quite simple, but can be useful if you start your project with Scala and AngularJS.

As a last note I'll just mention that I was given this Macbook Pro to work with ;) While I never agreed with how Apple works, but I have to admit that the quality of build of this machine is just superb.
